# Height Prediction Calculation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough of the Height-Diameter (HD) Modeling process in the Carbon Forest Analysis system. The process consists of three main steps: HD Model Assignment, Height Prediction, and Slanted Height Calculation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the height prediction process, ensure that:
- ✅ **Phase 1 (Data Selection & Validation)** has been completed
- ✅ Data has been imported and quality issues have been resolved
- ✅ Project schema exists with `tree_biometric_calc` table populated
- ✅ Forest species and physiography data are available in the system

## Phase 2: Height-Diameter Modeling

### Step 1: Assign HD Models

**Purpose**: Assign appropriate Height-Diameter models to each species in each physiography zone.

#### What You'll See

- **Overview Section**: Displays physiography zones with tree counts and HD model assignment status
- **Zone Cards**: Each physiography zone shows:
  - Zone name and number
  - Total tree count
  - Species count
  - Assigned HD model count (green)
  - Unassigned HD model count (amber)
  - Unassigned species count (red)

#### How to Proceed

1. **Review Zone Overview**
   - Check the physiography zone cards to understand the current assignment status
   - Look for zones with unassigned HD models (amber indicators)

2. **Automatic Assignment (Recommended)**
   - Click **"Assign All Models"** button to automatically assign HD models based on existing species-HD model mappings
   - This process uses the `species_hd_model_map` table to assign models based on species code and physiography zone

3. **Manual Assignment (If Needed)**
   - For zones with unassigned species, click **"Update species-HD model"** button
   - This opens a modal where you can:
     - Select HD models for each species
     - Enter model parameters (a, b, c values)
     - Save the mappings

4. **Verify Assignment**
   - After assignment, the zone cards will update to show:
     - ✅ Green indicators for successfully assigned models
     - Updated counts for assigned vs unassigned trees

#### Validation Requirements

- **Data Loaded**: Physiography zone data must be loaded
- **Models Assigned**: Either automatic assignment successful OR manual mappings saved
- **Next Step Button**: Will be enabled when HD models are assigned to trees

#### Troubleshooting

- **No Data Available**: Click "Refresh Data" to reload physiography zone information
- **Unassigned Species**: Use the "Update species-HD model" modal to manually assign models
- **Assignment Failed**: Check that species codes exist in the `forest_species` table

### Step 2: Predict Tree Heights

**Purpose**: Generate height predictions for all trees using their assigned HD models.

#### What You'll See

- **Overview Section**: Displays physiography zones with height prediction status
- **Zone Cards**: Each zone shows:
  - Zone name and tree count
  - Species count and assigned HD model count
  - Height prediction status with appropriate indicators:
    - ✅ **Green**: Height prediction successful
    - ⚠️ **Orange**: Height prediction partially completed
    - ⚠️ **Amber**: Height prediction not yet completed

#### How to Proceed

1. **Check Current Status**
   - The system automatically checks height prediction status for all zones
   - Look for zones that need height prediction (amber indicators)

2. **Run Height Prediction**
   - Click **"Run Height Prediction"** button for zones that need processing
   - The system will:
     - Query trees with assigned HD models and valid DBH values
     - Apply HD model expressions using species-specific parameters
     - Update the `height_predicted` column in the database

3. **View Results**
   - After successful prediction, zones will show:
     - ✅ Green "Height prediction successful" indicator
     - **"View H-D Relation"** button to visualize the height-diameter relationship

4. **Handle Partial Results**
   - If some trees failed prediction, the zone will show orange indicators
   - Click **"Re-run Height Prediction"** to process remaining trees

#### Technical Details

**HD Model Calculation Process**:
1. **Data Selection**: Trees with `hd_model_code IS NOT NULL` and `dbh > 0`
2. **Expression Evaluation**: Uses SymPy to parse and evaluate HD model expressions
3. **Parameter Application**: Uses species-specific parameters (a, b, c) from `species_hd_model_map`
4. **Height Calculation**: Applies formula: `height = expression(dbh, a, b, c, bh)`
5. **Database Update**: Updates `height_predicted` column for each tree

**Supported HD Model Types**:
- Linear models: `a + b * d`
- Logarithmic models: `a + b * log(d)`
- Power models: `a * d^b`
- Complex expressions with multiple parameters

#### Validation Requirements

- **HD Models Assigned**: All trees must have assigned HD models
- **Height Prediction Complete**: All zones must show successful height prediction
- **Next Step Button**: Will be enabled when height prediction is complete for all zones

#### Troubleshooting

- **No Trees Found**: Ensure HD models are properly assigned in Step 1
- **Expression Errors**: Check HD model expressions and parameters in the database
- **Partial Completion**: Re-run height prediction to process remaining trees

### Step 3: Slanted Tree Height Calculation

**Purpose**: Calculate corrected heights for trees that are not perfectly vertical using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### What You'll See

- **Overview Section**: Displays physiography zones with slanted height calculation status
- **Zone Cards**: Each zone shows:
  - Zone name and tree count
  - Species count
  - Slanted trees count (when available)
  - Calculation status with appropriate indicators:
    - ✅ **Green**: Slanted height calculation successful
    - ⚠️ **Orange**: Slanted height calculation partially completed
    - ⚠️ **Amber**: Slanted height calculation not yet completed

#### How to Proceed

1. **Check Current Status**
   - The system automatically checks slanted height calculation status for all zones
   - Look for zones that need slanted height calculation (amber indicators)

2. **Run Slanted Height Calculation**
   - Click **"Calculate Slanted Heights"** button for zones that need processing
   - The system will:
     - Identify trees that meet the calculation criteria
     - Apply the Pythagorean formula to calculate corrected heights
     - Update the `heigth_calculated` column in the database

3. **View Results**
   - After successful calculation, zones will show:
     - ✅ Green "Slanted height calculation successful" indicator
     - Count of trees processed

4. **Handle Partial Results**
   - If some trees failed calculation, the zone will show orange indicators
   - Click **"Re-run Slanted Height Calculation"** to process remaining trees

#### Technical Details

**Calculation Criteria**:
- Trees must have `height > 0`
- Trees must have `crown_class < 6` (excludes dead/broken trees)
- Trees must not already have `heigth_calculated` value

**Pythagorean Formula**:
```
corrected_height = √(height² + base_tree_height²)
```

Where:
- `height`: Original measured height
- `base_tree_height`: Height from ground to measurement point (null/negative values treated as 0)

**Database Updates**:
- Updates `heigth_calculated` column with the corrected height
- Updates `updated_date` timestamp

#### Validation Requirements

- **Height Prediction Complete**: Step 2 must be completed first
- **Slanted Height Calculation Complete**: All zones must show successful calculation
- **Next Step Button**: Will be enabled when slanted height calculation is complete for all zones

#### Troubleshooting

- **No Trees Found**: Ensure trees have valid height measurements and appropriate crown class
- **Calculation Errors**: Check that height and base_tree_height values are valid numbers
- **Partial Completion**: Re-run slanted height calculation to process remaining trees

## Best Practices

### Data Quality

1. **Verify HD Model Assignments**: Ensure all species have appropriate HD models assigned
2. **Check Model Parameters**: Validate that a, b, c parameters are reasonable for each species
3. **Review Height Predictions**: Use the H-D relation visualization to verify prediction quality
4. **Validate Slanted Heights**: Ensure corrected heights are reasonable for the tree species

### Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Processing**: The system processes all trees in a zone simultaneously
2. **Error Handling**: Failed calculations are logged and can be retried
3. **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status updates prevent unnecessary reprocessing

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Missing HD Models**: Check species-HD model mappings in the database
2. **Expression Errors**: Verify HD model expressions are valid mathematical formulas
3. **Parameter Issues**: Ensure a, b, c parameters are appropriate for the model type
4. **Data Inconsistencies**: Check for null or invalid values in required fields
